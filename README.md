The backend project serves as the server-side component of the e-commerce application. It handles requests from the frontend, performs business logic, interacts with the database, and sends responses back to the client.
Technologies used:
Node.js: A JavaScript runtime environment used for running server-side code.
Express.js: A web application framework for Node.js used for building APIs and handling HTTP requests.
MongoDB: A NoSQL database used for storing product information, user data, and other application data.
Mongoose: An Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB and Node.js, used for defining schemas and interacting with the database.
JWT (JSON Web Tokens): A standard for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object, used for user authentication and authorization.
